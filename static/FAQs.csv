What does MOPD Compliance mean?,"Even though the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires public places to provide accommodations for people with disabilities, many exceptions and exemptions exist to this law.

Our platform uses this dataset to populate the MOPD compliance data. Users can find out whether a restaurant is friendly to disabled individuals based on the accessible accommodations indicated by MOPD Compliant. These accommodations include entrance landings, doorway clear opening, the level route to wheelchair spaces, the level route to the 32-inch bathroom door, etc."
